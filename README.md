Binary Search Function
Overview
This Python script implements a binary search algorithm to find the position of a target element in a given sequence. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted sequence by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Usage
The binary_search function takes two parameters:

sequence: A sorted list or array in which the search will be conducted.
target: The element to be searched for in the sequence.
The function returns a string message indicating the position of the target in the sequence or a message indicating that the target is not present.

Algorithm
The binary search algorithm works by maintaining two pointers (low and high) that represent the current search interval. The midpoint of this interval is calculated, and the element at that position is compared with the target. Depending on the result, the search interval is adjusted until the target is found or the interval becomes empty.

Example
python
Copy code
from binary_search import binary_search

sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
target = 5

result = binary_search(sequence, target)
print(result)
Output:

arduino
Copy code
The target is at position: 4
Notes
Ensure that the input sequence is sorted before using this binary search function.
If the target is not present in the sequence, the function will return a message indicating that the target is not in the sequence.
Feel free to use and integrate this binary search function into your projects where efficient searching in a sorted sequence is required.
